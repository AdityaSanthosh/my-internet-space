title: I gave a short talk on Svelte at Ruby Conf 2024 India

Kind of odd, isn't it ? Speaking about JS in Ruby Conf.

When I visited Ruby Conf india 2024 in Jaipur, I am just thinking of listening to all the talks and network with others. At the end of the first day, one of the organizer asked me what I am upto these days and I mentioned that I am toying with svelte. He mentioned that they planned flash talks along with regular talks and asked me to participate. So I participated the second day

The night before, I did a lot of research for the talk. My goal was not to deep dive into any particular area of svelte because

1. this is a ruby conf and not a lot of people know about svelte
2. I myself don't know enough about it. (I discovered it just a few days ago)
3. I just have 5 mins to give the talk.

I decided to just introduce to audience that a framework called svelte exists and why it was created in the first place. I spent a lot of time the night before reading up blogs on why svelte was created in the first place. It basically requires less complex mental overhead to develop SPAs than react or angular. Also they have a compiler that converts svelte code to plain js unlike react at that time which ships entire react library and virtual dom code to the frontend leading to slow page loading times.

Despite just being 5 mins, I was amazed by the amount of prep required to give a talk. Making the slides, studying the content in depth so that I can answer people's questions, choosing what to present were the hardest parts of preparation for this talk. But it did give me a kick standing in front of people confidently speaking about a hard core technical concept.

Overall, it was a great experience. I spent hours in preparation for what's essentially just 5 mins. I do want to give a longer talk in the future. Hoping that happens soon. Finally, I will leave you with a personal favourite quote of mine

**Proper Preparation prevents poor performance**
